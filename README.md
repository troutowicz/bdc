BDC is a pattern that can be used when creating applications with [React](https://github.com/facebook/react). The idea is to keep components self-sufficient while being as minimal as possible. Components can obtain additional behavior via mixins.

This repository provides a simple example of an app built using BDC. [react-stamp](https://github.com/stampit-org/react-stamp) is used to handle composition.

```bash
npm build
npm start
```

The app is viewable on CodePen [here](http://codepen.io/troutowicz/pen/BoZqXX?editors=001).
